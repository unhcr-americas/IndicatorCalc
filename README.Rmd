# {IndicatorCalc}

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {IndicatorCalc} is to ease the implementation of standard calculation for survey indicators related to Forcibly Displaced Population.

The package is designed to work based on dataset standard backup format exported from [kobotoolbox](http://http://kobo.unhcr.org) within [UNHCR internal data repository](http://ridl.unhcr.org).

Each calculation is implemented as a function with in-built check to identify whether the expected variables and modalities are within the dataset. You can check each function reference to see in details all documented calculations

The package also includes:

 - a wrapper to chain all single calculations
 - a report template to output a quick exploration of all indicators results
 - a shiny app to provide access to the package online with Rstudio connect (versus offline rstudio)


## Usage

The easiest way to use the package is through the [shiny interface](http://rstudio.unhcr.org/IndicatorCalc)  and then follow the instruction from there 


## Developpers

You can install the development version of {IndicatorCalc} from [GitHub](https://github.com/unhcr-americas/IndicatorCalc) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("unhcr-americas/IndicatorCalc")
