Indicator functions are designed to work based on data stored as a list - which is
 the default structure for a complex hierarchical survey dataset with nested tables
 
 The default export format from kobotoolbox includes variables names generated as a concatenation of groups and names.
 
 The indicators calculation are based  on specific patterns to be identified within
 the variable names. This allow to handle cases where variables and questions would 
 have been shifted within the sequence of the questionnaire and through different 
 questions groups.
 
 The indicator functions also check that the data content is the one expected. 
 A check log is written to keep track of all issues
 



# Data Wrangling

Each indicator calculation is based on predefined frame, variable name and variable value.

Therefore each indicator function is organised in 3  steps:

 * Check if the standard frame/variable/modalities are already present in the dataset (organised as a list..) `fct_check_map`
 
 * If not apply the mapping supplied as argument within the function `fct_re_map`
 
 * Apply the calculation - either to append the new variable to the existing data or to output just the final vector with results. 




## fct_check_map

              variable = c("LIGHT01", 
                           "LIGHT03"),

# Generating data from a specific form definition

One key function is to generate a dummy dataset based on a specific form structure

To demonstrate the package we will use the standard questionnaire and then apply 
 each indicator function to demonstrate them.
 
We can then also re-use the function to create dummy data based on any form and then apply 
 each indicator function to actually verify which indicators can be created based
 on the form content.
